        <p>
            Founded in 2005, the Austin Hiking Club is a laid back community dedicated to outdoor exercise and 
            environmental stewardship. We host weekly hiking trips and provide volunteer opportunities for
            building and cleaning up trails. Our headquarters are located at 2222 Avenue St.
